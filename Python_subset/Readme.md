Many of the examples here are a sort of distributed processing
that we do not recommend doing in Python - the cost of using
Python is high and the overheads are large, so rather than
parallelising we would always recommend moving to a compiled
language.

However, the Worker-Controller model can work well in Python
so we show an example of it here.
